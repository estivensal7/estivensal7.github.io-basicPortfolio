		<p>My name is Estiven Salazar. I am currently 23 years old, and living in Summit, New Jersey. My family, and I moved to the United States when I was only 5 years old from Costa Rica. Upon graduating from high school I have worked in many job fields ranging from a full-time office sales position to assistant-manager of the Purchasing, Warehouse, and Logistics Departments for a small importer, and distributor of Specialty Foods. As well as serving, and bartender at several restaurants.</p>

		<p>Working in all of these different fields has taught me the discipline, and humility that I believe will assist me in overcoming the many adversities yet to come. I have recently chosen to pursue a career in Web Development, and it all began just out of curiosity as to how the internet works, and what the term "coding" really meant in a professional setting. Once I began to research these curiosities, I then became enthralled in the world of Web Development, and started trying to learn several languages on my own using the internet itself. After a few months I began to hear of Coding Bootcamps, soon enough I was extremely fortunate to begin the application process, and get accepted into the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp! I am unbelieveably excited to begin this process, and become a Full-Stack Web Developer!</p>
